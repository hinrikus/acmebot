acmebot for Debian
------------------

This package ships systemd service and timer units. There is no need
for configuring cron jobs to renew certificates.

An example config has been put to

    /etc/acmebot/acmebot.yaml

which only overrides the default directories used by acmebot.
Append your own configuration as described in the README or suggested
by the developer in the example config located in

    /usr/share/doc/acmebot/examples/
